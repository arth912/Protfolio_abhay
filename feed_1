					After all, Facebook connects billions of people. People who, thanks to Zuckerberg’s invention (that he allegedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jan/16/facebook-zuckerberg-winklevoss-legal-battle">stole</a> from others), would not have been able to make those connections. Without Facebook, what would social media look like today? We’ll never know. We do know, however, that we’ve never had to pay a dime for such an incredible service.</p>
<p>Instead, we’ve paid with our data. We’ve paid with our consumer profiles, locations, friend lists and more. It’s a payment that, in many ways, we never see. We don’t always recognize the tailor-made ads popping up in our feeds. Instead, it takes a cultural shock, like this Cambridge Analytica scandal, for people to realize what we’ve given up.

					<p>Per a class assignment, I’m supposed to analyze Zuckerberg’s apology <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104712037900071">here</a>. On first read, it sounds great. He explains the timeline, takes responsibility as a leader, points out the changes Facebook has made, all of it. Seems fine, right?</p>
<p>Except he never says I’m sorry.</p>
<p>He never really apologizes, or even pretends it’s an apology. Instead, it’s presented as merely an update. While acknowledging that Facebook made mistakes, he doesn’t specify what they were. He admits that there’s a breach of trust between Facebook and its users, but he doesn’t say it’s Facebook’s fault. Instead he simply says he wants to fix it.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
					<p>While I don’t know the legal situation (maybe he has a bigger reason for not admitting that Facebook’s privacy policies were too weak?), the apology rings hollow. He does well to point out the steps Facebook is taking to fix the issue (and the ones they’ve already taken), but without him taking more responsibility and expressing remorse at his own company’s actions, it’s not an apology.</p>
<p>There’s a quote that’s been floating around the internet for a while that I feel is particularly relevant here:</p>
<p>“If you’re not paying for something, you’re not the customer; you’re the product being sold.”</p>
<p>When it comes to Facebook, Zuckerberg would do well to take better care of his product, before it leaves for a different platform.</p>

					He discusses DVDs, a technology first revealed in the mid 1990s, which debuted at a high price point. They weren’t immensely popular at first, but then something changed. Home theaters became popular, Netflix began (as a streaming DVD service), and people began to use them. Netflix’s model beat the traditional VHS-based brick-and-mortar Blockbuster. </p>
<p>Later in the talk, he discusses how critical prices occur. When drugs were first released to combat AIDS, they were quite expensive, surpassing $10,000. Within just a few years, generic drugs drove the price down to $0.55 per day, allowing many more people to receive them. Basically, the longer a technology is around, the more value it loses.</p>
<p>Per Anderson, almost all technologies will drop so far in price that they will become somewhat free. Example- the music industry. Whereas people used to pay $0.99 per song for music, they now pay roughly $8 for unlimited music on services like Spotify or Apple Music.

<p>That’s totally fine; it’s an important step toward growing up. But if you’ve never worked before, applying for work may be intimidating.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Auburn offers students many opportunities to work hard, make a little money, and get some meaningful life experience. But how do you find those (and other) opportunities? Here are five quick ways:</p>
<h1>Check your inbox!</h1>
<p>Many department heads and professors will send out regular e-mails sharing tips and opportunities for employment and internships. My advisor, Ric Smith, sends out monthly posts full of internship opportunities with campus organizations, local companies and national businesses. Not every department offers this service, but many of them do.</p>
<h1>Visit the Career Center!</h1>
<p>Not sure whether to include your high school honors on your resume? No idea what a CV is? Auburn has a wonderful dedicated resource, the Career Center, designed to help you figure things out. They’ll give you a gorgeous (and free!) manual for writing the perfect resume, and they’ll go through yours, offering tips along the way. Prepping for an interview? They’ll help you with mock interviews and feedback – even after you graduate!</p>
<p>I talked with Julia, the rising Auburn senior who introduced me to the career center about its benefits.</p>
<h1>Look for a job online!</h1>
<p>Have you set up your LinkedIn yet? Yes, it sounds very adult-ish, but a solid LinkedIn profile can put you on a company’s radar. And don’t forget Handshake, either. In case you haven’t read any of the dozen emails Auburn has sent you about it, Handshake is basically LinkedIn for Auburn students, and employers go there to list jobs, to search for applicants, and to connect with the Auburn community.</p>
<h1>Practice your interview skills!</h1>
<p>Before a job interview, you’ll need to prepare. And a quick Google search of the company doesn’t count. Sit down, grab a notebook, and start taking notes. Find the organization’s about page on their website. They’ll share their mission, values, etc. on there. Discover what they care about, and keep that in mind during your interview.</p>
<p>Also, research common interview questions for the job. Make sure you can answer those, like really well. What’s your biggest weakness? That’s a tough one, especially if they’re putting you on the spot. Here’s how to prep for it.</p>
<p>Research like it’s an upcoming final exam, except instead of taking a test, you’re trying to talk people into giving you money to do stuff for them. It’s a big deal (especially if you’re traveling just for the interview), so prepare for it like one.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, don’t psych yourself out. If you’re visibly nervous and uncomfortable in the interview, it’s going to send the wrong message. Practice for a bit, and find your perfect balance.</p>
<h1>Visit Recxpo!</h1>
<p>As a Campus Recreation  employee, this is a shameless plug, but whatever. Recxpo is Auburn Campus Recreation’s semiannual job fair. Featuring nine departments and a casual atmosphere, <a href="https://i2.wp.com/jackmparrish.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DSC_7209-X3.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-29 size-medium" src="https://i2.wp.com/jackmparrish.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DSC_7209-X3.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="Auburn Students Filling out Job Applications" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://jackmparrish.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DSC_7209-X3.jpg 1600w, https://jackmparrish.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DSC_7209-X3-1080x721.jpg 1080w, https://jackmparrish.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DSC_7209-X3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://jackmparrish.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DSC_7209-X3-768x513.jpg 768w, https://jackmparrish.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DSC_7209-X3-1024x684.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Recxpo offers students the chance to gain meaningful experience, connect with other members of the Auburn family, and (most importantly) the chance to get paid! Whether you’re a freshman or senior, graphic designer or aerospace engineer, there’s a place for you at Campus Recreation.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t worry about bringing a resume. We’re chill like that. Just grab a friend, come to The Rec, and learn about some of the cool ways we’re helping students on campus. You know, by paying them money to do stuff for us.</p>
<p>I talked with Julia, an Auburn senior who works at The Rec,  about her experience.</p>
<p>“The Rec is great because they are very flexible on hours and they put your academics first, so you don’t have to worry about falling behind,” she said. “And I love my coworkers. They keep me sane.”</p>

<p>Jack: First off, so what’s the deal with GMOs? Should they be avoided? Are they safe to eat?</p>
<p>Anne Penrose: Regarding genetically modified foods, they have had their DNA manipulated usually for some sort of production purpose. There are many GMOs and (as of now) there is not sufficient research indicating that they are less nutritional or harmful compared to their non-GMO counterparts. So basically, more research needs to be done.</p>
<p>JP: Artificial preservatives — how bad are they for you?</p>
<p>AP: This is a question that could be answered with quite a lengthy response. My recommendation, as usual, is to eat in moderation.</p>
<p>We do not need to fear artificial preservatives, per se, but I do recommend balancing packaged foods containing artificial preservatives with raw, whole foods.</p>
<p>Now, we’ve been conditioned to think “processed foods” are unhealthy foods. What people don’t realize is that most foods are processed to some degree; we rarely eat food straight from the source right to our plates without any processing. But this does not necessarily mean it is unhealthy; processed foods can fit into a healthy, balanced diet.</p>
<p>Now I do think we can try to limit artificial sweeteners when possible. I would recommend sweetening a drink with a small bit of real sugar than an artificial sweetener, for example.</p>
<p>JP: Let’s talk about the gluten-free craze for a bit. For people who don’t have an intolerance or celiac disease, is gluten-free food any healthier than food containing gluten?</p>
<p>AP: If you have celiac disease or suffer from gluten intolerance, then eating foods containing gluten will lead to you experiencing GI upset. In this case, you need to limit or eliminate gluten from your diet entirely. For the person without gluten sensitivity, it is not necessary to avoid gluten for health purposes. Basically, gluten is made up of proteins that give structure to grains and is not something to fear eating or eliminate for “health” purposes.</p>
<p>In my experience, I’ve seen two types of people who choose to follow a gluten-free diet when it’s not due to gluten sensitivity. You often will have the person who goes down the packaged food aisle at the grocery store and buys gluten-free labeled food items as his or her way of eliminating gluten.</p>
<p>They aren’t going to change everything — they’re still going to get crackers, but they will purchase the gluten-free kind.</p>
<p>Then you have the person who is going to try to eat gluten-free by decreasing packaged foods and gluten-containing grains while replacing those foods with increased fruits, vegetables and whole foods.</p>
<p>These are two different diets, but they’re both gluten-free. Now, the second person will probably eat more fresh produce, while incorporating the other aspects of a healthy diet.</p>
<p>This increase in fruits and vegetables is a great thing, but it isn’t the gluten-free aspect that is increasing this person’s nutrient intake. Again, for the average person with no reason to decrease or limit gluten, it is perfectly okay to eat foods containing gluten!</p>
<p>JP: How much do “cleanses” really help your body? Are you really flushing out toxins?</p>
<p>AP: (Laughing) No. That’s another one that I hear often in my office. Our kidneys and liver do this for us naturally. There is no cleanse that is going to flush toxins out of your body. Honestly, just sticking to a well-balanced diet is much better for you.</p>
<p>JP: Most importantly, is breakfast really the most important meal of the day?</p>
<p>AP: Not technically, although it does help you to start the day with the fuel you need to think and move! But there’s nothing special about breakfast itself. You see, it’s really a matter of perspective.</p>
<p>The entire concept of meals is really a man-made idea. You could be someone who prefers to eat three big meals and 2-3 smaller snacks, or you could be someone who prefers to graze and eat 6-7 smaller meals throughout the day.</p>
<p>There is no one perfect way to eat; you need to figure out what works best for you. It’s just important to eat regularly and consistently each day while meeting your calorie and nutrient needs.</p>
<p>I would never recommend to skip breakfast and go all day without eating and then consume a huge meal at the end of the day. Because that’s not going to meet your nutrient needs, and you’ll probably overeat since you’ll be starving.</p>
<p>Plus, you’ll probably struggle to mentally function well in the morning, since you won’t have enough calories in you. My favorite saying: the most important meal is the one you’re eating right at that moment!</p>

					Everybody loves photography, right?

According to Business Insider, it looks great on a résumé. It’s artsy, classy, and a cool way to show off your creativity. But there’s a bit of a learning curve. Whether you’re interested in a new hobby or just want to take better pictures, you’re in the right place.

					The biggest hurdle on the path to becoming a good photographer is price. To buy a low-end DSLR camera, you need to spend at least $350. And that may not even include a lens. I saved hundreds of dollars by buying my camera used with a few old-school lenses on a somewhat-sketchy camera swap website for $630. I got lucky, but most people can’t afford to drop hundreds of dollars on a hobby that may not work out.</p>
<p>If (like most beginner photographers) you own one of Nikon or Canon’s entry-level models, you may be a little disappointed with your early photos. You’ll see gorgeous photos on Instagram and feel jealous. <em>Why can’t my photos look like that?</em> Do yourself a favor, and visit Flickr’s camera finder <a href="https://www.flickr.com/cameras/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">website</a>. You can see photos taken with your camera model (and even pictures from people’s phones). This helps you determine your camera’s potential. But why are their photos so much better? There are a few reasons.</p>
<p>Below are a few beginner-based points to help you boost the quality of your photography. If you haven’t yet been introduced to photography, then you may not understand some of the terms or phrases. Open an extra tab in your browser. If you don’t recognize a term, simply google it. I’ll explain most within the text.</p>
<p>Please note I’m directing these points toward owners of DSLR and mirrorless cameras. If you have a point-and-shoot, a couple of these tips may not help you. Don’t know which type of camera you have? Visit this <a href="http://www.whatdigitalcamera.com/buying-advice/buying_guides/choosing-a-camera-type-advice-to-help-you-buy-a-camera-2-12271" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">website</a> and learn about the differences.</p>
<h2>Understand Exposure</h2>
<p>When shooting, be aware of your camera’s settings. Your aperture, ISO and shutter speed settings work together to decide the brightness of your pictures. Think of them as a balanced triangle. In addition to brightness, these determine your photo’s motion blur, digital noise and depth of field. Here are a few links that explain how they work. Watch a few <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CllmmXswtK8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">videos</a>, do your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understand-exposure-in-under-10-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">research</a>, and then get out there and practice.</p>
<h2>Know Your Camera</h2>
<p>Even if you fully understand how exposure works, if you don’t know your camera, then it won’t matter. Different cameras will place their settings and shortcuts in different places. Search YouTube for tutorials on your camera’s model, and take notes. Get outside and try them out for yourself. Practice is vital.</p>
<p>I own a Sony A6000 mirrorless camera. It’s not flashy, and it’s a midrange camera at best. But I can get better photos out of it than my department’s Nikon D7200, a relatively high-end DSLR. I know my camera’s settings and potential, and I’ve got months of practice. Having a prime lens also helps.</p>
<h2>Buy a Prime Lens</h2>
<p>In photography, there are two categories of lenses: prime and zoom. Zoom lenses are exactly what you’d expect, lenses that can zoom. Prime lenses, however, have a fixed <a href="http://improvephotography.com/34730/focal-length/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">focal length</a>, meaning they can’t zoom. They aren’t as versatile as zoom lenses, but they generally make up for it by offering wider apertures and sharper images.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://cdn.pcwallart.com/images/bokeh-lights-photography-wallpaper-4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">soft</a> <a href="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/bokeh.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">bokeh</a> effects in the background often add beauty to a setting and help your subject stand out. Prime lenses offer a shallower depth of field, which causes this effect. Most amateur photographers have multiple lenses, generally including a basic 18-55mm kit lens, a telephoto zoom lens, and at least one prime lens.</p>
<p>Again, price may be an issue. A solid 50mm lens with a f/1.8 aperture costs between $100-200. If you are just getting into photography, don’t worry about buying a prime. Get your camera and a basic zoom lens (either a flexible 18-135mm or simply an 18-55mm), and start shooting. Consider picking up a prime later.</p>
<p>Warning: Watch out for gear acquisition syndrome (GAS). With photography, people often begin to think, “<em>If I just had that </em>one <em>lens/camera/flash, my photos would be so much better.”</em>That’s not true. Yeah, a nice camera helps, but so do nice composition, lighting, and ability.</p>
<h2>Use Post-Processing</h2>
<p>Those gorgeous photos you see on Instagram from professional photographers? Yeah, those have probably been edited. Like, omg-I-can’t-believe-that’s-even-the-same-photo edited. Most professional photographers use software from the Adobe Creative Suite like Lightroom and Photoshop. These, naturally, cost money. And even with student discounts, they may be outside your budget ($9 per month). Thankfully there are also excellent free options <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-free-photo-editor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">available</a>.</p>
<p>I use Adobe Lightroom, which operates similarly to Instagram and VSCO’s apps. Easily adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, and do minor touch-ups. Then simply export. If you’re serious about post-processing, consider shooting your photos in RAW format instead of JPEG. It preserves much more information about your photo and gives you more flexibility in editing. <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/raw-vs-jpeg/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Here’s</a> a list of the pros and cons of shooting in RAW format.</p>
<h2>Learn Proper Lighting</h2>
<p>The difference between good photos and bad ones? It’s often the lighting. Most beginners won’t have an extensive flash setup in a studio. That’s okay — I don’t know anyone that does. Just focus on <a href="http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/natural-light-photography.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">natural lighting</a> for now. Learn the differences between soft and harsh lighting. SPOILER ALERT: You generally want the soft stuff. Also, check out <a href="http://www.photographymad.com/pages/view/the-golden-hour-in-photography" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">this article</a> on golden hour, which is one of the best times for beautiful lighting.</p>
<h2>Understand Composition Techniques and Rules</h2>
<p>Ever looked at a photo, saw that it was pretty, but still thought something was just <em>off</em> about it? It’s probably the composition. There are tons of subtle rules in photography and videography about how you compose and style your shot. Thankfully, you don’t need a fancy camera to have good composition.</p>
<p>To improve your pictures, learn the rule of thirds and other <a href="http://www.photographymad.com/pages/view/10-top-photography-composition-rules" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">compositional guidelines</a>. Again, practice is important. These rules rarely come naturally, so work to incorporate them into your photos. When people refer to a photographer’s eye, this is typically what they mean. Don’t forget to consider whether your subject is interesting. Does anyone actually want to look at this? Is it compelling? These questions often don’t have easy answers.</p>
<h2>Finally, Consider Joining a Community</h2>
<p>If you’re just shooting on your own, you will probably improve, but feedback and tips can prove invaluable. Whether you join a photography club in Auburn or an online group, some of your best lessons will come from others. They can offer advice on gear, let you borrow lenses, and offer opportunities for photo shoots. Some may even introduce you to potential models for your shoots. I regularly find helpful tips and advice on Reddit’s r/photography page, which was an awesome resource during the camera-buying process, too.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in photography, but are on a tight budget, don’t sweat. Grab your phone and just shoot. Recent-model smartphones have excellent cameras (and iOS 10 can even shoot in RAW on iPhones). Although photography snobs may shake their heads and grumble, it’s important to realize that your photography is what you make it. And with proper lighting, composition and settings, you’ll be making it much, much better.</p>
